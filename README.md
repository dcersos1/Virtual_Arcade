Welcome to my Virtual Arcade!

The project functions as follows: 
  
  The user is welcomed to the game and given the instructions on how to play. They are allowed to choose their difficulty level which gives them a different amount of lives (1,2, or 3). After this choice they are given another choice between three mini games; rock paper scissors, trivia, and word-game. After this, they enter the mini game. For word-game, they have a choice of 5 difficulty levels. After choosing, they are given the length of the word and can guess one letter at a time. The incorrect guesses are registered and displayed to the user and if they accumulate too many, then they lose the mini game. They win if they are able to guess the word or phrase correctly before they have too many incorrect attempts. In trivia, you are also given a choice of difficulty and get a question after choosing. You are given 3 guesses to get the correct answer and then move on to the next game after this is over. Rock paper scissors has no difficulties, the way it works is that the user plays against the computer. The computer randomly chooses rock, paper, or scissors and the user has to try to beat it. The first to win 4 times wins the mini game. The user continues to play these mini games until they run out of lives and when this happens they are given a score of how many mini games they won.
