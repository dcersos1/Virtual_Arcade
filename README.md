Welcome to my Virtual Arcade!

In order to run the arcade, open and run the .ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook

The project functions as follows: 

  The user is welcomed to the game and given the instructions on how to play. They are allowed to choose their difficulty level which gives them a different amount of arcade lives (1,2, or 3). After this choice they are prompted with a choice between three mini games; rock paper scissors, trivia, and word-game. After this, they enter their chosen game. For word-game, they have a choice of 5 difficulty levels. After choosing, they are given the length of the word and can guess one letter at a time. The incorrect guesses are registered and displayed to the user and if they accumulate too many, then they lose the game with a deduction of an arcade life. They win if they are able to guess the word or phrase correctly before they have too many incorrect attempts. In trivia, you are also given a choice of difficulty and get a question after choosing. You are given 3 guesses to get the correct answer and are deducted an arcade life if you fail to get the answer in 3 attempts. Rock paper scissors has no difficulties, the way it works is that the user plays against the computer. The computer randomly chooses rock, paper, or scissors and the user has to try to beat it. The first to win 4 times wins the mini game. The user continues to play these mini games until they run out of arcade lives and when this happens they are given a score of how many mini games they won. 

Thank you for viewing and I hope you enjoy the Virtual Arcade!
